# Notes on installing pc-skeletor on Windows 11

There is a bit of trouble shooting to be done and using the pip command does not seem to work at all.  
You need first to download some compilation tools and add them to the path environment variable. 

Open Anaconda prompt. 

Then run the following code: 

```
git clone https://github.com/meyerls/pc-skeletor.git 

cd pc-skeletor

python setup.py build
python setup.py install --user
``` 

If you get the error that you cannot import name "url_quote" from werkzeug.urls, then: 

```
pip install werkzeug==2.3.8
```

should set you up nicely. 

Then you will need to copy some dlls in the same folder as the relevant pyd files, as explained here.
